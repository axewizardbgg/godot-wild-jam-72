# Abduckted

You're a Duck that was experimented on by a Wizard! Unfortunately the experiment has gone wrong and brought a curse to the land, and you're the only hope of keeping the light alive.

Made this with my sons, you can play it on itch.io, here: https://axewizardbgg.itch.io/abduckted

## Developer Notes

As with all gamejam entries, this was made as a rushed hobby project so don't expect my best code quality.

The `Main` scene is where I started, later adding `TitleScreen` and `Credits`. I'll post a link to my devlog video when I finally get around to making it. For now I just want to sleep.
